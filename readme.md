## how to test
```
cargo test

## how to run
```
cargo run

## Note
If you want to do unit testing on a small scale, you can keep the tests in the same file as the main code. However, if you want to perform unit testing on a larger or more complex scale, you should place the unit tests in a separate file, similar to how integration tests are handled.
